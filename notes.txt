sbt sits on top of Maven and Ivy
actions - a function that takes a request and returns a response
controllers
routes
`run` from the sbt prompt to start it. Once it's done, it will start the server on localhost:9000, and curl http://localhost:9000/
You need to set the perm gen size higher; export this before sbt `SBT_OPTS="-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=512M"`
args are not parameters to Action but to method that produces action (?)
Need to give the types because compiled to Scala, no chance for type inference
Can you make closing slashes optional?
https://playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ScalaHome is useful.
A view a html file that compiles to Scala (I think...)
returns a type called Content
